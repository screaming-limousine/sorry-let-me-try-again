Just another repository
Ive spent all the years of my life interacting with other humans solving the moments of when passersby become entangled in the processes and numbers and variables in equations if our trajectories collide into a tangible thing where enemies or friends or all creations in between take shape from a malleable state and infunenced by interaction whether physical or verbal or both which I admit have made many enemies by way of my own self-centered shortcomings and narcissism with no justifiable motive at times other than just being a dick yet ive also made lasting friendships that to have been selfishly neglected, however my time of self-loathing is at its end and severe anxiety and depression have caused stressful complexities in my relations but no longer I viable excuse am ready for the dawn of a new era. I want to be and feel real again I want to feel the texture of life that I can no longer perceive gazing into the obscured memmories ive suppressed....also I'm great at learning new things and I spend way too much time online doing absolutely nothing, plus I can adapt to my environment as fluid as a chameleon to overcome any situation. Sorry about any typos and no punctuation and poor grammer it was a lot to type I got a really bad device whose battery is rapidly depleting and yea not sure if it's experince like ive stated that you are looking for but we could create a great unknown experience together.
